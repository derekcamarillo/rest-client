# Typed Rest and Http Client with TypeScript Typings

A lightweight Rest and Http Client optimized for use with TypeScript and async await.

## Features

  - Rest Client with typescript generics and async/await/Promises
  - Http Client with pipe stream support and async/await/Promises 
  - Basic, Bearer and NTLM Support out of the box
  - Typings included so no need to acquire separately (great for versioning drift)
  - Layered for Rest or Http use
  - Full Samples and Tests included for usage

## Install the library
```
npm install typed-rest-client --save
```

## Samples

See [samples](./samples) for complete coding examples

### Typings

Typings (.d.ts) are distributed with the client, so intellisense and compile support just works from `tsc` and [vscode]()
