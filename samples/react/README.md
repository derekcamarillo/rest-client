# Typed Rest Client React Sample

## Description

This is a basic example of using Typed Rest Client with `react` in the browser.

It uses `react-scripts` library (basically, it's a `webpack` under the hood) to work in the browser.

## Requirements

It requires `nodejs` >= `14.x` to run.

It's recommended to use `npm 8.x` to in order to minimize the friction between package-lock formatting.

To run this sample, enter following commands at the command line:

```sh
npm i
npm run start
```
